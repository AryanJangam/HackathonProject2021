I have been working at Accenture full-time for more than a year<br>
Pros<br>
The work in Accenture is really good. The support received from colleagues is amazing. You will learn a lot from senior colleagues. Good work life balance. They have also begun revising salaries to meet industry standards. They focus on learning new skills and provide a variety of trainings to broaden knowledge.
Cons<br>
Sometimes you get mapped to projects even if the skill set doesn't match your skill set - mostly for freshers. But you'll learn none the less.</h3>
